Runs analysis in python.

Requires invocation through the application.

ALTERNATIVELY:
    -Have indexers forward their data into something like Snowflake through the service as a proxy.
    -Have triggers in the DB to generate reports
    -Still requires an element of EDA, so that doesn't seem feasible until there's a cut and dry path forward.
